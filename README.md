 Important
-----------

* This style is written for, and will only work with seaweedchan's 4chanX fork available [here] [1].

* The 4chan logo in the top left works as the header-bar menu button and the text "4chan" opens the settings.

* To open full-board list use the keybind ctrl + b.

* Open the Quick reply by pressing "i" close it by pressing esc.

* Most likely doesn't work on Chrome. If it doesn't, quite frankly I don't want to work on it to get it to work on Chrome.


Installation (assuming Firefox)
-------------------------------

* Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.
