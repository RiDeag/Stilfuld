 Important
-----------

* This style is written for, and will only work with seaweedchan's 4chanX fork available [here] [1].

* You MUST have "Current" in your custom navigation.

* "Ctrl+B" will toggle the board list into view by default.

* For the Quick reply to work properly, you must have "Persistent QR" and "Auto Hide QR" enabled.

* Open the Quick reply by pressing "i" close it by pressing esc.

* Hover your mouse at the bottom left to view thread stats, bottom right to toggle thread watcher and top right to view header bar menu

* Most likely doesn't work on Chrome. If it doesn't, quite frankly I don't want to work on it to get it to work on Chrome.


Installation (assuming Firefox)
-------------------------------

* Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.
